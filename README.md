Synopsis
========

Underbar is an exercise in reverse engineering the popular Underscore.js JavaScript library.

Motivation
----------

This project was an assignment provided to me by my mentor at Bloc. Aside from being excellent supplemental JavaScript practice, this exercise helps demystify the inner workings of a popular JavaScript library and illustrates that anyone can create great things!
